## I've spent enough time here that's it's beginning to enter on weeb territory

By the time I finish my current trip to Japan, I'll have spent a total of 4 months here within the space of 3 years.
It's now the country I've spent the most time in outside of Australia, and I've come to appreciate a lot of things about it and dislike very few.

## Love

- So quiet and serene everywhere (except the major tourist areas)
- No street parking + focus on pedestrian infrastructure
- Almost all cars are hybrid or electric so there's very little noise pollution on the street
- Arguably the best food in the world
- Safest country I've ever visited
- Incredible public transport
- Rich culture deeply ingrained in respect and politeness
- No tipping anywhere
- The Japanese refuse to overcharge even when they could so easily get away with it in some places

## Hate

- Smoking indoors at some restaurants/bars
- Lots of bicycles on the footpath
