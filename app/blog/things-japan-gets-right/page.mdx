## I've spent enough time here that's it's beginning to enter on weeb territory

By the time I finish my current trip to Japan, I'll have spent a total of 4 months here within the space of 3 years.
It's now the country I've spent the most time in outside of Australia, and I've come to appreciate a lot of things about it.
This list is an ongoing ramble of the things I like here, that keep me coming back, as they occur to me.

### Focus on serenity

Japan is home to some of the most populated cities on earth, yet everywhere I go, it's so quiet and serene.
The vast majority of cars are hybrid or electric so road noise is minimal, which makes a huge difference to the noise level of big cities.
People here also wouldn't dare honk their horns unless it was an emergency.
Generally everyone speaks in hushed tones, even when outside and when on public transport there's often complete silence.
The deeply ingrained culture of respect here means everyone goes out of their way to avoid disturbing others, this manifests in a lack of loud music and anti-social behaviour.

### Pedestrian-first infrastructure

TODO - no street parking, good public transport, etc.
