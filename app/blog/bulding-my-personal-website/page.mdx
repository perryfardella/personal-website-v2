## The long way round

I've been procrastinating over rebuilding my personal website for a long time.
I finally got around to doing it, and it took me a lot longer than it should have.
I procrastinated a lot, tried out a lot of new technology and changed designs about a million times.

## The destination

In the end, I used Next.js and MDX to build my website. I'd never worked with MDX before so that was a fun experience.
On top of that, I'm using shadcn for my components and Tailwind CSS for styling. I also used v0 for the first time
to generate some of my custom components and WOW, it's a seriously powerful piece of tech, I'm very impressed.

## Borrowing from the best

Now I'm a dev, not a designer so I don't really plan out the design of the sites before I build, I just put them together.
Which makes for quick building, but it also means I struggle to end on a design that feels coherent and that I really like.
So I decided not to re-invent the wheel and leaned on some of the best devs out there for inspiration, in particular
[Lee Robinson](https://leerob.com/) and [Dario Amodei](https://darioamodei.com/)'s personal website were huge inspirations for the design of mine.
I loved the minimalism, simplicity and cleanliness of their sites and I tried to emulate that in mine.
I know a lot of devs go all out with their personal sites to impress others, but I think I'd prefer to keep mine clear and concise
and let my projects speak for themselves.

Hopefully this will be the last redesign for a little while and I can focus on building some cool projects to showcase on here.
