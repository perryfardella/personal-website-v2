## The why

My old personal website sucked. It was cluttered, nonsensical and also had next to no content on it.
I'm planning on spending a lot more time on personal projects this year and I wanted a place to showcase them.
I also wanted to start writing more, so I needed a blog. So I decided to kill two birds with one stone and build a new personal website.

## The how

Here's the stack I used:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for the blog
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting
- [v0](https://v0.dev/) for easily designing custom components and helping with styling
- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for base components and themeing

It's a very modern stack, which I went for on purpose because I'm trying to get better at all of the tools I deployed here.

## The style heist

Now I'm a dev, not a designer so I don't really plan out the design of the sites before I build, I just put them together.
Which makes for quick building, but it also means I struggle to end on a design that feels coherent and that I really like.
So I decided not to re-invent the wheel and leaned on some of the best devs out there for inspiration, in particular
[Lee Robinson](https://leerob.com/) and [Dario Amodei](https://darioamodei.com/)'s personal website were huge inspirations for the design of mine.
I loved the minimalism, simplicity and cleanliness of their sites and I tried to emulate that in mine.
I know a lot of devs go all out with their personal sites to impress others, but I think I'd prefer to keep mine clear and concise
and let my projects speak for themselves.

Hopefully this will be the last redesign for a little while and I can focus on building some cool projects to showcase on here.
