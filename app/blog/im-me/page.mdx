## So I decided to create a new email address using my domain name

So last night I created a new email address for myself, using my custom domain.
So now you can reach me at [me@perryfardella.com](mailto:me@perryfardella.com).

Up until this point I've been an Outlook/Gmail man, but thought since I now have my own custom domain, I should use it.
It feels very liberating to be a bit more control of my email also. Of course I'm still using an external email provider, but I can change that at any time.

It's also just been a fun learning experience working out how to actually use my domain to set up a custom email address.
Then there's setting my new email address up on my phone and computer, testing everything works as expected, etc.

## The how

I use Namecheap for my domain registration, and they offer an email hosting service.
I did some research online about what my options are and that seemed like the best value option for my needs.
So right now I'm paying just over $4AUD/mo for over 30GB storage as well as all the features you'd expect from an email provider.
