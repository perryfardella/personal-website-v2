## Supa-base...?

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, both of these services are something called a BaaS (Backend as a Service).
Essentially this just means that these services provide a backend for your apps, so you don't have to worry about setting up your own.
Supabase can be self-hosted, or you can use their hosted service for a fee, although there is a generous free tier.
I use Supabase because it handles everything for me, user auth, database, storage, emails, etc.
It allows me to get a new project off the ground quickly, and I can focus on the frontend and business logic.

## Supabase UI is awesome

Now with Supabase doing all the grunt work on the backend, I can focus on the frontend code for my projects.
However, the people over at Supabase wanted to make my life even easier, so they released Supabase UI.
